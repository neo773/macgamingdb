## The Short Version

**CrossOver** translates Windows code to macOS using Wine and direct-to-Metal translation layers. No Windows license needed, minimal overhead, and significantly better performance than virtualization. The $74 first-year cost drops to $34/year on renewal. Works great with modern AAA games—the main limitation is anti-cheat, not game age.

**Parallels Desktop** runs actual Windows in a virtual machine. Broader compatibility for games with anti-cheat systems, but the VM overhead means lower frame rates. You'll need both a Parallels subscription ($99.99/year) and a Windows license ($139+). Best for users who need Windows for work or must play anti-cheat-protected games.

## Understanding the Technology

The question isn't really "CrossOver or Parallels"—it's "translation layer or virtual machine." These are fundamentally different approaches to the same problem.

### CrossOver: Translation Without Windows

CrossOver is built on Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator), an open-source compatibility layer that's been in development since the 1990s. When you run a Windows game through CrossOver, it intercepts the game's Windows API calls and translates them to macOS equivalents in real time.

Think of it like a simultaneous interpreter at the UN. The game speaks Windows, CrossOver translates to macOS on the fly, and your Mac executes the instructions. No actual Windows operating system is involved.

This approach has real advantages. You're only running the game itself—not an entire operating system underneath it—so there's less overhead. CrossOver uses memory dynamically based on what the game needs rather than reserving a fixed chunk for a VM. And since there's no Windows, there's no Windows license to buy.

The catch? Translation is hard. Some Windows features don't have clean macOS equivalents. Modern graphics APIs like DirectX 12 are particularly challenging. And anti-cheat systems that check for a "real" Windows environment will usually fail.

### Parallels: Actual Windows on Your Mac

Parallels Desktop creates a virtual machine—a simulated PC running inside your Mac. You install a real copy of Windows 11 ARM, and games run in that environment exactly as they would on a Windows computer.

The game thinks it's on a Windows PC. Windows handles all the DirectX calls natively. Parallels just has to translate the final graphics output to your Mac's display.

This means broader compatibility. If a game runs on Windows, it'll probably run in Parallels. Anti-cheat systems see a "real" Windows environment. DirectX 12 games that won't even launch in CrossOver often work fine in Parallels.

But you're running two operating systems simultaneously. That means reserving RAM for Windows (typically 4–8 GB), significant disk space for the Windows installation, and the overhead of virtualization. You'll also need to buy Windows, which adds $139–200 to your costs.

## Graphics Translation: DXVK, DXMT, and D3DMetal

Here's where things get technical—and where CrossOver has gotten dramatically better in recent years.

Windows games talk to graphics cards using DirectX. Macs use Metal. Getting DirectX calls to work on Metal requires translation, and there are now several ways to do it.

### The Translation Stack

**wined3d** is Wine's original Direct3D implementation. It translates DirectX to OpenGL, which then gets translated to Metal via Apple's deprecated OpenGL support. This double translation is slow and limited, but it's been around forever and handles some edge cases well.

**DXVK** translates DirectX 10 and 11 to Vulkan. On Mac, this requires another layer (MoltenVK) to translate Vulkan to Metal. Two translation hops: DirectX → Vulkan → Metal. It works, but the overhead adds up.

**DXMT** is a newer Metal-based implementation of DirectX 11, developed by 3Shain and now integrated into CrossOver 25. This is where things get interesting: DXMT translates D3D11 *directly* to Metal, skipping the Vulkan middleman entirely. One hop instead of two. The performance difference is substantial—games that stuttered with DXVK often run smoothly with DXMT, especially on lower-spec Macs.

**D3DMetal** is Apple's translation layer from the Game Porting Toolkit. Like DXMT, it goes directly to Metal—no Vulkan in between. It supports both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, making it the only option for DX12 games in CrossOver. Apple developed this to help game studios port titles to Mac, and CrossOver has integrated it for consumer use.

### Why Direct-to-Metal Matters

The old approach (DXVK + MoltenVK) meant every frame went through two translation steps. With DXMT and D3DMetal, you're cutting that in half. Combined with Rosetta 2's remarkably efficient x86-to-ARM translation, CrossOver now runs many games with near-native performance.

This is why CrossOver often *outperforms* Parallels despite Parallels running "real" Windows. Parallels has the overhead of an entire virtualized operating system. CrossOver just has the translation layer—and with direct-to-Metal backends, that translation is fast.

### What CrossOver 25 Does Automatically

The good news: you usually don't have to think about any of this.

CrossOver 25 includes all four translation layers and automatically selects the best one based on its compatibility database. When you install a game, CrossOver checks which backend works best and configures it for you. You can override this in Advanced Settings if you want to experiment, but the defaults are solid.

For DirectX 9 games, CrossOver typically uses wined3d or DXVK. For DirectX 11, it'll often pick DXMT. For DirectX 12, D3DMetal is the only option.

### The DirectX 12 Reality

D3DMetal has matured significantly. CrossOver 25 runs DirectX 12 titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Street Fighter 6, Dragon's Dogma 2, and The Last of Us Part 1. Many modern AAA games work well—the main barrier isn't DirectX 12 itself but anti-cheat systems.

When a DirectX 12 game runs in CrossOver, it typically runs *better* than in Parallels. You're not fighting VM overhead. The direct-to-Metal translation is efficient.

Parallels' advantage is compatibility breadth, not performance. If a game has aggressive anti-cheat or checks for a "real" Windows environment, Parallels has a better chance of passing those checks. But for games that work in both, CrossOver delivers higher frame rates.

**The practical approach:** Check [Mac Gaming DB](https://macgamingdb.app/?playMethod=CROSSOVER) for your specific games. If they run in CrossOver, that's your best option. Fall back to Parallels only for titles that require it.

## Which Mac Models Work Best?

### Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4)

All Apple Silicon Macs can run both CrossOver and Parallels, but your experience will vary based on RAM and GPU cores.

**8GB RAM:** CrossOver works fine since it uses memory dynamically. Parallels is tight—Windows needs 4GB minimum, leaving only 4GB for macOS and any background apps. Playable for lighter games, but you'll feel the squeeze on anything demanding.

**16GB RAM:** The sweet spot. Parallels can allocate 8GB to Windows while leaving plenty for macOS. CrossOver handles everything comfortably.

**32GB+ RAM:** Overkill for gaming, but useful if you're running Parallels for work and gaming simultaneously.

GPU cores matter for graphics-heavy titles. The base M1/M2 chips have 7-8 GPU cores. The M3 Pro and Max variants scale up to 40 cores. More GPU cores = better frame rates, especially at higher resolutions.

### Intel Macs (2015–2020)

Intel Macs run x86 Windows natively, which means theoretically better compatibility since there's no ARM translation layer involved. In practice, the older GPUs and limited Metal support on these machines often bottleneck performance anyway.

If you have an Intel Mac, Boot Camp (installing Windows directly on a separate partition) remains an option for maximum game performance. Neither Apple nor Microsoft officially supports this anymore, but it still works on existing hardware.

## Cost Breakdown

### CrossOver

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| First year | $74 |
| Renewal (years 2+) | $34/year |
| Windows license | $0 |
| **5-year total** | **$210** |

CrossOver's 50%+ renewal discount is significant. That $34/year gets you continued updates, including new translation layer improvements and game compatibility fixes.

Alternatively, the $494 lifetime license makes sense if you plan to use CrossOver for 7+ years.

### Parallels Desktop

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Standard Edition | $99.99/year |
| Windows 11 Home | $139 (one-time) |
| **5-year total** | **$639** |

The perpetual license option ($219.99) eliminates the subscription, but you won't get major version updates. Most users stick with the subscription for ongoing compatibility improvements.

Student/education pricing drops Parallels to $49.99/year if you qualify.

### The Hidden Cost: Your Time

CrossOver requires checking compatibility databases, occasionally tweaking settings, and accepting that some games won't work. If you value your time highly and want things to "just work," Parallels' premium is easier to justify.

If you enjoy tinkering and don't mind the occasional troubleshooting session, CrossOver's lower cost and lighter footprint make more sense.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up CrossOver

**Time required:** 10–15 minutes

1. Download from [codeweavers.com/crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) and install
2. Launch CrossOver and click "Install a Windows Application"
3. Search for your game or choose "Install an unlisted application"
4. CrossOver downloads dependencies and configures the bottle automatically
5. Install your game from Steam, GOG, or an installer file

**Checking compatibility first:** Search the [Mac Gaming DB for CrossOver titles](https://macgamingdb.app/?playMethod=CROSSOVER) before buying. User reports include specific settings and performance notes for your Mac model.

### Setting Up Parallels

**Time required:** 45–60 minutes

1. Download from [parallels.com](https://www.parallels.com) and install
2. Parallels will prompt to download Windows 11 ARM—this takes 20–30 minutes depending on your connection

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I play my entire Steam library on Mac?**

Not every game—anti-cheat is the main blocker, not compatibility. Check the [Mac Gaming DB](https://macgamingdb.app/?playMethod=CROSSOVER) for CrossOver compatibility or [Parallels listings](https://macgamingdb.app/?playMethod=PARALLELS) to see what works with each method.

**Do I need to buy Windows for CrossOver?**

No. CrossOver doesn't use Windows at all—it translates Windows API calls directly to macOS. This is one of its biggest advantages.

**What about anti-cheat games like Fortnite or Valorant?**

Most kernel-level anti-cheat systems (Easy Anti-Cheat, Vanguard, BattlEye) don't work reliably in either CrossOver or Parallels. Parallels has slightly better odds since it's running "real" Windows, but many competitive multiplayer titles remain problematic on Mac regardless of method.

**Which is faster—CrossOver or Parallels?**

CrossOver, often by a significant margin. With direct-to-Metal translation (DXMT, D3DMetal) and Rosetta 2's efficient x86 translation, CrossOver runs games with minimal overhead. Parallels has to run an entire Windows OS underneath your game, which eats into performance.

**Is there a free alternative?**

Whisky was a popular free option, but development ended in April 2025. The developer recommended switching to CrossOver. Apple's Game Porting Toolkit is free but requires significant technical setup and is intended for developers, not end users.

**Which is better for M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs?**

CrossOver, in most cases. Rosetta 2 is extremely efficient, and the direct-to-Metal translation layers (DXMT, D3DMetal) were designed with Apple Silicon in mind. Parallels works on Apple Silicon but adds VM overhead that hurts frame rates.

**Can I run both CrossOver and Parallels?**

Yes, though not for the same game simultaneously. The smart approach: try CrossOver first. If the game runs, you'll get better performance. Only use Parallels for games that specifically require a full Windows environment (usually anti-cheat games).

---

## Bottom Line

**Start with CrossOver** for the best gaming performance. With translation layers like DXMT and D3DMetal going directly to Metal—and Rosetta 2 handling x86 translation with minimal overhead—CrossOver consistently outperforms Parallels by a significant margin on compatible games. Modern AAA titles work fine as long as they don't use kernel-level anti-cheat. The 14-day trial lets you test your must-play games before committing.

**Go with Parallels** only if you need Windows for work anyway, or if your specific games require anti-cheat systems that won't run in CrossOver. You'll pay more, use more resources, and get worse frame rates—but you'll have a full Windows environment for the games that genuinely require it.

The performance gap isn't subtle. CrossOver runs games with essentially no overhead beyond the translation itself. Parallels runs an entire operating system underneath your game. For any title that works in both, CrossOver wins.
